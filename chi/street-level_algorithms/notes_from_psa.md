suchman tries to reason about plans as a sub-problem of "situated action", which we can generally think of as actions and the surrounding contexts that inform them.
she helps explain this thought process by describing 5 **propositions** through an ethnomethodological lens. (but are those propositions comprehensive, necessary, or sufficient?)

i think if bardzell is doing something similar, it's to frame *design* as a sub-problem of *feminist theory* (in some sense).
she then describes a few qualities that emerge when we apply a feminist theory framing. this isn't comprehensive, but it's illustrative of a few of the ways that this framing helps

postcolonial computing arguably does something similar; positioning all these ICT4D problems as subsets of postcolonialism










how can i frame our work through this?


**non-human policy?**

what are laws vs what are policies?



all of the ~~AI problems~~ how web platforms work we're seeing in society are subproblems of bureaucratic/governance issues, and the disconnect between how people think the world works and how it does work?

- governance on platforms is opaque => people frustrated (twitter, youtube)
- blockchain appeals to people for reasons that are sort of "free democratized web" ish
- enforcement of governance is opaque, catches everyone(?), punishes equally, but doesn't punish fairly?
half (???)


lens: governance is the issue; automated systems are incapable of dealing with the issues
**non-human bureaucracies can't (yet?) replace the bureaucracies we deal with offline**


halfaker on wikipedia => growth; designed ways to deal with that growth, but that gave them a ceiling (or hampered them later?)


we've designed these platforms to be open and democratic, but dealing with bad actors has resulted in bad outcomes of their own



what's AI here? it's just a tool to make decisions about stuff when we see something:

- how we identify scammers, harassment, etc...

why is AI so visible in this moment? "changing the traditionally negotiated bounds of what these systems attempt to do at scale"

- people are interfacing with AIs now in places and ways that we used to say was impossible to mediate
- wikipedia used to give people a bullet point list to check
