A theory of street-level algorithms suggests that, when faced with algorithmic failure, we should look to historical cases of street-level bureaucrats for design inspiration.

Bureaucratic mechanisms for appeals and justice include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ensuring that the person or system reviewing the appeal does not overlap with the person or system who made the initial judgment
  \item Predefined rules for recourse, (e.g. compensating lost income)
  \item Requirements to publish plain-language descriptions of complex systems
\end{itemize}
