- Introduction                     7/10       *lots* of room for citations, lots of room for wordsmithing
- Street--level bureaucracies      ?/10       too recent for now
- Case studies                     /10     
  + Youtube                        9/10       this is pretty well honed. some wordsmithing but i wouldn't jump to do this before other sections
  + Algorithmic justice            7/10       especially coming on the heels of the youtube case, it feels like we suddenly ran out of things to say
  + Crowdwork                      9/10       we're back in our wheelhouse. maybe this is 10/10. it's not as long as the youtube case but i don't think we need to convince an audience of the validity of crowdsourcing as a topic of inquiry like with youtube. maybe that's the same reasoning behind the AI justice case study being a little shorter too?
- Design implications              6/10       i bet we could go on for pages and pages about potential designs and stuff. i think we even cut paragraphs from the case studies with the intention of them ending up in some speculative section like this. maybe those need to be brought in here?
- Discussion                       7/10       the bones of the discussion are a little more "there" than the bones of a full DI section, but i kind of waived my hand at the other potential case studies
- Conclusion                       8/10       same as above, but a conclusion doesn't have as much distance to close to be complete the way the other ones do.
