{More than is usual for me, the process of making sense of these ideas was much more collaborative than the author list implies, for obvious reasons. My unending gratitude to Nana Young, Razvan Amironesei, and Rachel Thomas for their time and thoughts as we worked through earlier versions of some of these ideas. This work also benefited from reviewers who were willing to see through the shortcomings of the initial submission, and went above and beyond to help make this paper the best version of itself that it could be. It would literally not have been possible if not for their extraordinary generosity and care.}
