\begin{frame}{Taking a step back}
% Several provocations
\begin{enumerate}
  \item On--demand work is a modern instantiation of piecework
  \item What is work going to look like in the future?
  \item How can workers \alert{organize}, \alert{govern}, and \alert{act} in environments increasingly controlled by the platforms on which they work?
  \item What sorts of \alert{values} would we build into the walls of factories, if we could?
  \item How do we \alert{evaluate} the success or failure of systems intended to empower and uplift workers?
  \item How can we ensure that platforms that empower workers in negotiations with employers don't also \alert{endanger} those workers?
\end{enumerate}

      % Seems sort of coming out of nowhere if I just talk about complexity.}
    % \begin{itemize}
    %   \item What is the \emph{future of work} going to look like?
    % \begin{itemize}
    %   \item Dystopian? Utopian?
    % \end{itemize}
    % \item Probably a little of both
