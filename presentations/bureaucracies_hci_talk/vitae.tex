% ## 5. The system (Vitae) [`10 minutes`]
% ### multi-faceted system: [`7`]
% 1. **A browser extension**, which scrapes data and handles notifications
% 2. **A website**, to store that information and mediates discussions, and 
% 3. **A client side script**, which mediates worker qualifications
% - _[al2: I need pictures for this, don't i?]_

% ### We're going to evaluate two questions: [`3`]
% 1. does vitae facilitate more accurate "conventional" work? That is, are on-demand workers more reliable transcription, image labeling, etc...
% 2. does vitae allow people to form communities representing highly skilled, niche workers?


% ## Deployment [`3 minutes`]
% - We're working with the Laboratory for Social Research at Stanford to bootstrap up to 70,000 workers (so we know about them and seed them with _some_ known attributes that are valuable)
% - field experiments testing these communities and their abilities and willingness to act; **quantitatively measurable**
% - **qualitative fieldwork** into the shift of agency among workers in these groups
