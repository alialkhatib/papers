msb advice: add more framing at the beginning about how this is an exploration of how we might design future of work platforms --- not just study them --> instead of diving straight into crowd work

# TALK [`10 minutes, ~1 hour for discussion`]

## Intro
- Crowdwork is growing in size and complexity
  + People are doing more with crowdwork
  + People are using crowdwork more
  + *Chart with line going up*
- Crowdwork actually has a lot to do with gig work and the sharing economy;
  + Mediating the sale of resources in smaller chunks than usual, often regarding workers as "contractors" (in some cases, arguably, wrongfully)
- It's all "on-demand labor"

## Problem as we see it
- In a lot of markets, there's pervasive uncertainty about the quality of the work (or the worker) being offered by the labor platform.
- This is leading employers to mistreat workers, underpay, and generally assume the worst;
  + Market for lemons
- Workers can't escape this vicious circle with little to no reputation to build on, and limited dimensions to articulate professional identity

## Insight
- Pieceworkers had to deal with this; at the turn of the 20th century, we saw the birth of labor advocacy organizations like **hiring halls**
- History can give us ways of handling all of these phenomena:
  + scaffolding to frame what's happening
  + language to properly describe what we're seeing
  + paradigmatic views to inform what we design, and how
    * (caveats abound - engineers != omniscient, or omnipotent, and we should be careful not to think we are)
- Hiring halls!
  + gave people ways of articulating ground rules, and pushing back on requesters and work that violated those rules.
  + They also gave workers the ability to trade on their *collective* reputation, which had substantial value compared to individually
  + Together, they could effectively negotiate for better treatment and conditions

## What We're Building
- Vitae is a system that keeps track of myriad communities of specialized and highly qualified workers across any number of work platforms.
- Vitae ensures that workers are members of any given community or communities, and can range from algorithmic, objectively determined groups (such as approval rate, geographic location, etc...) to subjective (e.g. workers trusted by the Stanford HCI Group, skilled artists)
- These communities have places to communicate, decide norms and expectations of themselves and of employers, and discuss work available to them.
- Employers can use Vitae to ensure that they hire better workers and get higher quality work output, but in doing so they agree to be subject to the collective governance of these respective communities of workers
  + Workers can **flag** tasks for violating the ground rules of the group, which prompts a discussion in the community's chat room, where members are called to adjudicate the question of whether the specific task in question is allowable by the group's rules.
