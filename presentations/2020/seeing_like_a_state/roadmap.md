I want to hit the arguments in the following way:

- scientific forestry
- roadmap (wow this is meta)
- information => data => knowledge => wisdom (or something)
  + we're doing this with the datafication of everything
    * examples
      1. quantified self
      2. impact of our writing (clicks, claps, etc)
      3. brainstorm more examples (or "activity?" hahah)
- this is more problematic than it appears at first glance
  + we measure the wrong things, and create nonsensical reward systems
    * examples:
      1. we reward walking, but lag in acknowledging other forms of activity
      2. clickbait rewards for click-through rates
      3. ??? another thing, parallel to the 3rd example from before
- these feedback loops precipitate behavior that we don't necessarily want
  + algorithmic systems learn to reward weird things in weird ways
    * examples:
      1. those YouTube kids examples
      2. the hollowing out of journalism
      3. CV-defeating clothing/makeup? that seems kinda cool though
      4. ???
- What should we do about it?
  + If the danger is taking an overly narrow view of the world, we need to think more about the ecology of the data we're working with (generating, translating, consuming, etc...) (cite McNealy)
  + To turn that into recommendations, we as designers have to take a more coherent and justice-centered stance toward working with, accommodating, or stymieing authoritative bodies (Stuart)
  +
