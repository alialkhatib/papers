\begin{frame}{(Re)framing the question}
Persistent issues in on-demand work
\begin{itemize}
\item People have varied work histories
\item How can we be confident that on-demand workers are qualified?
\item Work histories are often reduced to 5-star or binary ratings
\item Workers' histories not necessarily reliable
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Hiring Halls}
  Hiring halls historically ameliorated these issues:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Varied, transient work histories offset by relatively stable organizations
    \item These organizations traded on their collective reputations
    \item Hiring halls consolidated negotiation between employers and workers
  \end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Digital Hiring Halls}
\textbf{Digital} hiring halls can be even more impactful
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item<+-> Arbitrarily niche communities of specialized professionals
    \item<+-> Eliminate the need for workers to get work exclusively from one source
    \item<+-> Facilitate collective governance for on-demand knowledge workers
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}


% ## 3. Framing the problem [`3 minutes`]
% - Open questions in on-demand work: how can we be confident that on-demand workers are capable and qualified?
% - People have varied work histories
% - work histories are reduced to 5-star ratings and thumbs-up/thumbs-down
% - workers' histories aren't necessarily trustworthy
% + _complex work is an impossible outcome in these circumstances_
