      % \item i didn't know much about how people who experience disabilities may be willing to go to great lengths to avoid having to disclose that to others if they can help it (e.g. reluctance to disclose to customer service representative, asking about how something looks)
      \item made me reflect on whether you can trust the \strong{passively} collected data to reveal this stuff (or more precisely, how I should make more effort to actively seek out this stuff if i'm designing something)
