  \item Every county in the continental US received ≥1 edit from male editors; only 1/3 of the counties received ≥1 edit from female editors
  % \item less than 3\% of the {counties} in our dataset have a higher ratio of female edits to male edits.
  \item {there's a {rural/urban dimension} } % read the paper for more info}
  % \item rural counties had a higher proportion (nearly 5\% greater) of male edits compared to the proportion of female edits

  \item {there's a {racial/diversity dimension} } \hfill {\scriptsize read the paper for more info on both}
  % \item the least racially diverse counties received a higher proportion (8.92\% greater) of the male edits compared to female edits

  % \item A male produces only 0.51 times what a female produces in the most diverse counties, but produces nearly 3.78 times that in the least diverse counties

  \item male editors created more edits with bots than female editors did

  \item ``\alert<1>{women editors were more likely to contribute [more] information about \em{masculinized spaces}} relative to men, and \alert<2>{men were more likely to contribute [more] information about \em{feminized spaces}} relative to women''
