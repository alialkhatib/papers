%   We're 
%   % \begin{itemize}
%   %   \item Build complexity \emph{into} processes
%   %   % \item Make incremental advances toward \alert{tracking} and \alert{standardizing} workers and work
%   %   \item Major challenges with \alert{flexibility}

% ## Deployment [`3 minutes`]
% - We're working with the Laboratory for Social Research at Stanford to bootstrap up to 70,000 workers (so we know about them and seed them with _some_ known attributes that are valuable)
% - field experiments testing these communities and their abilities and willingness to act; **quantitatively measurable**
% - **qualitative fieldwork** into the shift of agency among workers in these groups
