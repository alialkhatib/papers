# roadmap about positivism

## Story about colors
- We all love this color (let's say green or whatever).
- Green is about 530 nanometers. It's the reflection of light at that wavelength and the absorption of other colors. There's a physical, empirical quality to it. We can measure it anywhere in the universe. Green is green is green.
- Is it though? Do we all see and experience the **same** color?
  + Maybe not. Maybe my blue is your pink. We know some people can't differentiate between certain colors - 1/12 men and 1/200 women have this characteristic where they have fewer cones in their eyes and can't see as many colors as others. Some people (mostly women) have more cones than the average person, and can differentiate *more* colors than average.

## Introduction - the theme is _positivism_, and the work to articulate against it
- this talk is about positivism, or rather the critique of positivism that differentiates Anthro and some other social sciences fields from a lot of the rest of the sciences. antipositivism is the heart of why hard sciences don't respect fuzzy social scientists, but it's not necessarily widely understood, and certainly not taught in depth as this basic assumption about **Knowledge**.

### What is positivism?
- positivism is the basic idea that you can establish positive facts (hey there's that word) with empirical evidence. That all real knowledge - Knowledge - is provable through observation and measurement, and everything else is beyond knowledge. At its heart, positivism says that you can be objective with regard to the thing you're studying - the way you can separate yourself from the thing you're studying such that someone else could follow the exact same procedures that you describe and come to the same findings.

So it should come as no surprise that pretty much all experimental research depends on this assumption; if you couldn't say with certainty that you can make the researcher objective to the subject of study, and make it possible to replicate the study from beginning to end, then what would be the point of the Scientific Method?

So positivism is the underpinning assumption of a lot of science as we think of it.

This talk will be about the problems with positivism.

## Benge
- In the Congo (or thereabout) there's a tribe called the Zande. They have various forms of witchcraft that they use to figure out stuff. If they're not sure whether they should plant a crop in a given field, or they're worried one of their wives is possessed, or they want to understand why this specific person was standing under the granary at the specific moment that its legs gave out and fell on him, they'll consult various oracles. The one I want to tell you about is Benge, the Poison Oracle.

The poison oracle ritual involves a shaman acquiring this thick red paste from some distant land, mixing it with water, and feeding that paste to a chicken provided by the patron who wants a question answered. Questions have to be posed in a yes/no format, and the patron has to provide several chickens. Shamans take the chickens, feed one of them this red paste, ask the pertinent question, and watch the chicken's behavior. If the chicken survives, the answer is yes; if the chicken dies, the answer is no. They run the same procedure again, but asked counter-factually, to confirm the oracle's answer.

Benge is immensely important; its answers are as good as legally admissible. If the poison oracle confirms that you're guilty of witchcraft, that's all they need. It explains the malady that someone in the village has suffered, and it provides an explanation to all the coincidences and accidents that we typically dismiss as random chance. The Zande don't believe in such a thing. They believe in Benge.

EE Evans-Pritchard tried to explain the science of Benge - that this material they were getting from some distant land was strychnine and you could calculate (or at least estimate) the fatal dosage of strychnine for a chicken that weighs some amount - but the Zande weren't interested. This was nonsense to them - something they couldn't see and that didn't fit into how the world works.

So why am I telling you about this?

Because people want to know what's unknowable - why did my brother get hurt, or why is my wife sick, or will I be successful in some consequential endeavor. and more importantly, people will develop methods for understanding things that give them some reassurance that they can understand what's going on in the world.
Whether that way of understanding the world corresponds to the way you understand the world is totally irrelevant; the internal logic is what matters, and importantly as you can see here, the internal logic of culture is consistent.

## On the Run
- Alice Goffman spent like 6 years rolling with a street gang in Philadelphia, studying their culture and learning about how they viewed and dealt with the world. In one notable story, she wrote about how she learned that people in the gang wouldn't go to the hospital with GSWs (gunshot wounds) because the police would come and arrest them.

In the immediate aftermath of the publication of _On the Run_, hospital workers came out to say that there's no way this happens; as a matter of policy, they would never reveal the names of patients or the medical conditions to police for exactly the reason that if they did, people would refuse to seek medical attention when they needed it, and they would very likely die.

What's interesting about this story is that there are multiple accounts going on here, and a positivist would probably struggle to make sense of what's going on, or worse they would dismiss the behavior of the gang as wrongheaded or mistaken. But that's the wrong place to end up. Where you should try to end up is by understanding that people have different relationships with the same things in the world that we interact with.

Members of the gang Goffman studied live a life that's in conflict with (or at least adversarial toward) the institutions that we generally know and trust. Police don't keep the peace; they harass and kill Goffman's friends. Courts don't mete out justice; they coerce her friends into taking guilty pleas and into prison for decades. Hospitals aren't safe places to get help; they're traps.

Does it matter whether the hospital rats out patients? No. Not really. What matters is the trepidation people feel about going to the hospital. Their experience of the "same" world is different from yours or mine, and what matters isn't what's provable or repeatable, but what's _experienced_, and how that informs their decisions and feelings about things in the world. And you have to not judge that (which would include evaluating the truth value of their understanding of the world).



## Malinowski (argonauts of the Western Pacific)

Malinowski got stuck in Papua New Guinea. We don't talk about this very much, but we should. The dude was insanely racist and hated the people he was studying. It was a big controversy when they published his personal journals from his time studying the Trobrianders, but
