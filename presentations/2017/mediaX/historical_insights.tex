% ## 4. Historical insights to digital solutions [`5 minutes`]
% - Hiring halls!
% - We're building a system that aggregates workers' histories into one place
% - digital hiring halls can do a few cool things:
%   1. you can make highly specialized communities for the same (small) cost as making a general specialization group
%   2. you can eliminate the need to source work _exclusively_ through a single pipeline (as offline hiring halls tend to)
%   3. they can foster and facilitate collective governance more overtly than embodied structures can

\begin{frame}{What Does Piecework Say?}
  % What we'll find
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Build complexity \emph{into} processes
    % \item Make incremental advances toward \alert{tracking} and \alert{standardizing} workers and work
    \item Major challenges with \alert{flexibility}
    \item Emphasis on task \alert{specialization}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Takeaways}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We make stronger assumptions about workers' abilities thanks to technology
    \item Evaluation remains difficult, but we're trying to find stopgap solutions through decomposition
    \item We're still not solving the problems of inherently subjectively judged work
  \end{itemize}
