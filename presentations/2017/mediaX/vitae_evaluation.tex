\begin{frame}{Evaluating Vitae}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item<+-> Does Vitae facilitate ``conventional'' work?
    
    \small{Work like image labeling, transcription, etc\dots which we can evaluate quantitatively by comparing to ``control'' settings}
    \item<+-> Does Vitae allow workers to form communities representing niche and specialized skills?

    \small{Evaluating this will take more time and require longitudinal, ethnographic study}
  \end{enumerate}
  % We'll deploy it to a bunch of turkers and make some communities and it'll be great you'll see okay next slide
  % \begin{itemize}
  %   \item Build complexity \emph{into} processes
  %   % \item Make incremental advances toward \alert{tracking} and \alert{standardizing} workers and work
  %   \item Major challenges with \alert{flexibility}
  %   \item Emphasis on task \alert{specialization}
  % \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% ### We're going to evaluate two questions: [`3`]
% 1. does vitae facilitate more accurate "conventional" work? That is, are on-demand workers more reliable transcription, image labeling, etc...
% 2. does vitae allow people to form communities representing highly skilled, niche workers?
