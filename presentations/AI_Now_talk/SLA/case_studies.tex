% We'll go into depth on one of the cases that we explored in the paper, but we'll also discuss at higher level
% a handful of cases

% We'll go into depth on YouTube, but in the paper we go into similar depth about a number of other cases that we'll only touch on briefly: algorithmic justice, and crowd work evaluation.

% We're going to turn this lens toward content demonetization 

We work through this theory the same way for each case:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Introduce the problem
  \item Describe the street-level algorithm in the setting
  \item Reflect on what the scholarship about street-level bureaucracies says
\end{enumerate}
