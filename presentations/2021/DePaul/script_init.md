algorithmic systems have become 






hi, i'm ali, i'm the director of the center for applied data ethics at the university of san francisco.

i want to talk about some of the work i do.

mostly the work i do means finding theories from other fields and translating them into the domain of HCI to try and find some new foothold or insight that wasn't obvious (or maybe even accessible) without that theory. i do this because the language we use to talk about things is arguably the most important technology there is. language, motivated by theories and frameworks, can bring ideas into and out of focus, into and out of frame, and arrange them on a plane that makes clearer how things may be related where that relationship wasn't obvious before.


<!-- i'm going to show how all that happens when we choose different ways of framing and approaching problems in tech and design. i'll take you on the path that i took in getting here: -->

i want to show you what i mean. and i want to show you how i got here.

- i'll start by telling you a bit about piecework
- then i'll talk about street-level algorithms,
- and what it means "to live in their utopia";

- and then i'll say a bit about where i'm looking, where i think i'm going from here.

i've been thinking about 



i've been frustrated with the state of my area of HCI for a while. i'm not sure that i even know what my area of HCI is, but let's say that it's generally social computing. and being a field of HCI, that means *the design of* social computing environments.

i've thought about and worked largely in the on-demand work space, with Niloufar Salehi who's now at UC Berkeley [dynamo][], and at microsoft research and later the SEIU and NDWA to build platforms for worker-owned cooperatives of domestic and service workers. but 






i've been frustrated about something that i've been trying to circle and get at over the past years.
the source of that frustration is probably best described by techno-utopian advocates who push ahistorical narratives of society as though it were languishing in waiting for the internet and other technologies to arrive.

not only is this obviously not true, but the supposed hallowed nonsense of technology as some futuristic savior is itself totally wrong. tech is culturally situated in broad and narrow ways, deeply and indelibly influenced by the circumstances surrounding its progression.

i want to show you what i mean
