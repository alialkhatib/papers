hi everyone, my name's ali. i want to talk about something that's been frustrating me for a few years now.

EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN

I've been studying on-demand work for a number of years. and by that i mean things like gig work and crowd work - uber, postmates, amazon mechanical turk, upwork, doordash, and other platforms like that.

and i even went beyond studying how workers endured and worked through those platforms, thinking about ways that i could affect change in those environments. in the gig work side, i worked with the national domestic workers' alliance to build a system allowing workers to book clients and communicate with each other. it was called "alia", and it was a worker-owned cooperative.

and on the crowd work side, with a stellar team of undergraduate and graduate researchers, we built a system that would give crowd workers a way to bring their credentials and reputations with them to other platforms, so they could accumulate evidence of their professionalism and expertise incrementally. it was called "vitae", and in reality it was a digital hiring hall.

these weren't new ideas; we were trying to tap into decidedly old strategies to accomplish an underlying goal. with alia we ultimately came to realize that the issue workers were trying to address was precarity, and they needed relief. with vitae, workers were struggling to build a sense of shared identity and shared fate.

worker-owned cooperatives are a way of getting relief from precarity, and similarly hiring halls are one way to build solidarity, but they're not the only ways, and at the core these systems were trying - and failing - to bring solutions to deep cuts in society, sharp underlying social issues that no technical system could facilitate.

we learned that lesson with alia - we gave the domain back to the NDWA, debriefed with our contact about how we were coming to terms with the reality that a CS PhD student collaborator wouldn't be the most effective resource for things like portable benefits and more robust health care and paid time off (indeed, that my presence seemed to lead conversations towards technical interventions even when a system wasn't appropriate, just to make use of me). alia still exists. i understand it's doing well. i consider that a success.

...

everything we do ...

if we're serious about ethics and justice, we need to be serious about understanding the histories of the people we're working with, or acting upon, in imagining potential futures.

thinking along these lines forces us to confront our complicity in violence, but this can inspire us to break away from that extractive, abusive system.

Fundamentally, the kind of work that i do involves finding, translating, and applying theories from other fields - like sociology, anthropology, political science - fields that have honed and tested and refined their theories over decades of scrutiny. and then i try to find ways to adapt those frameworks into the spaces and technologies that otherwise sell themselves as something novel, or something radically innovative.

i want to show you what i mean. and i want to show you HOW i got here.

- i'll start by telling you a bit about piecework
- then i'll talk about street-level algorithms,
- and what it means "to live in their utopia";

- and then i'll say a bit about where i'm looking, where i think i'm going from here.
