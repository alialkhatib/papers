# Papers that we've published
## (or otherwise made available to people)

This is the repository I use for papers that have been made public. There are a few quirks, like the absence of a `references.bib` file, which you'll need to compile the LaTeX documents in here, but I'm thinking about how to make that work with respect to some stuff behind the curtain that you probably don't care about.

Let's hope this works!
